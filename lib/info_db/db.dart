It starts when the Barak River from northeast India divides at the Bangladesh border into the Surma and the Kushiyara rivers.The Surma is flood-prone in the monsoon. The flood season is generally from the last week of May to the middle of October, the mean discharge in this period being about 30,000 cusec.

The Barak (western) receives the Gopla and the khowai from the Tripura hills, and falls into the Surma at Madna.The way these rivers change their names is indeed confusing. To make matters worse, it seems that there is no general agreement as to identify a river course by a single name, rather the entire course of the river may bear different names along its path. The Surma from Ajmiriganj downstream is often referred to as the Meghna. The matter would be simple but for the fact that from Madna downstream for about 26 km (in a straight line) one of the two channels of the Surma-Meghna is known as the dhaleshwari.
